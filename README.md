SFAF Plotter Application Summary for Demo Recording

Application Overview

SFAF Plotter is a comprehensive military frequency coordination mapping application that implements MCEB Publication 7 standards for frequency assignment processing (Source: main.txt, handlers.txt, index.txt).



Core Features for Demo

1. Dual Interface System

Map View : Interactive Leaflet-based mapping interface with real-time coordinate tooltips (Source: index.txt)

Database Viewer : Professional database management interface with advanced search and analytics (Source: db_viewer.txt)

Seamless Navigation : Toggle between map and database views via navigation bar (Source: index.txt, db_viewer.txt)



2. Advanced Marker Management

Manual Markers : Create draggable markers with frequency and location data (Source: map.txt, handlers.txt)

Imported Markers : SFAF file import with automatic coordinate parsing (Source: services.txt)

Real-time Coordinate Conversion : Decimal, DMS, and military compact formats (Source: services.txt, main.txt)

Visual Tooltips : Display coordinates in multiple formats on hover (Source: map.txt)



3. Military Compliance Features
